Hello! 👋👨‍💻

I'm Alex, a self-taught developer who enjoys working on back-end APIs and libraries; sometimes will dabble in the front-end.

I like writing clean, tested code and advocating for software development best practices and tools that help teams write better code.

This space is a collection of various helpful bits I learned every day in my journey.
